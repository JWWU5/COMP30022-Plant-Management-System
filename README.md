# COMP30022 Team Project

## About our project
This web application named ‘PvsZ’ (only for phone size) used for tracking the plants' condition and help our users take better care of their plants. The tools we used are React, MongoDB and Node.js. In this app, the user can add plants, remove plants, search plants, record the details of their plants, group their plants and get the alert message if the plant needs to be watered, sunshined or other actions should be taken. this project will span about 12 weeks and will be done so in Agile Methodology, we choose to divide the work in 3 sprints. Furthermore, except the general functions, this app also follows the client requirements. 
See the full list of requirements at our [Confluence](https://jwwu5.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IP/overview?homepageId=196693)
